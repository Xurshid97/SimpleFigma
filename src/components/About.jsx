        Nikola Tesla [a] , Serbian.  Никола Тесла (born July 10, 1856 in Smiljan , died January 7 , 1943 in New York [2] ) - Serbian - American engineer from Croatia [b] [3] ; electrical engineer , radio engineer and inventor.

        Tesla was the designer of many devices for generating and using alternating current , effectively competing with Thomas A. Edison , who only used direct current .

        He was the author of nearly 300 patents that protected his 125 inventions in 26 countries [4] (the information about over 700 patents [5] is contrary to literature data [4] ), mainly various electrical devices, including an electric motor and a current generator alternating current , autotransformer , bicycle dynamo , radio , hydroelectric power plant (at Niagara Falls) [6] , solar battery , disc turbine and Tesla transformer ( resonant high-voltage coil ).

        Tesla created, among others: one of the first devices remotely controlled by radio. Initially, Guglielmo Marconi was considered the creator of the radio , but in 1943 the Supreme Court of the United States granted patent rights to Tesla [7] . The trial was resolved after the inventor's death, and Marconi is generally considered to be the creator of the radio , even though he admitted to using Tesla's earlier work to build the radio.

        In 1916 he was awarded the Edison Medal "for outstanding achievements in early work on polyphase and high-frequency currents" [8] .
